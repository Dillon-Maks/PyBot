# Discord-Bot
PyBot is a Discord bot, written with discord.py. It has xp/leveling mechanics, economy, and minigames!

So atm, whenever it's online. It has 4 commands and a lot of behind the scenes stuff
*pay (User#0000) (amount)
*coinflip (amount)
*xpcheck
*creditcheck
You gain xp by sending mesages, and after x amount of xp, you level, gaining credits.
With credits, you can do minigames (more to come), such as coinflip. Coinflip requires a wager, and you have a 50/50 chance of winning the bet
The pay command is used to give other users credits, taking them from your credits.
